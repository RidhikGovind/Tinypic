# Tinypic  :minidisc:

#### Compress your images offline without sacrificing privacy. 

#### Flashback:  I used to compress my images either using various free online compression tools.
But I later found out that its not safe since you can't always do that with images having sensitive info.
So I decided to make my own - Tinypic
